## Ruby & Ruby on Rails setup (Mac OS):

Since OS X includes old version of Ruby and we can't replace it, we need to use rbenv.

```
Brew install rbenv
```
```
Rbenv init
```
```
rbenv install 3.2.2
```
```
rbenv global 3.2.2
```
rbenv version (This command should return 3.2.2, if it's old version re-do rbenv installation)
```
ruby â€”version
```
```
gem install rails
```
```
gem update --system 3.4.19
```

Now, you should have Ruby & Ruby on Rails on your computer
